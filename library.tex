% In this section we review existing approaches to working with graphs developed
% by the functional programming community.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Tying the knot:
%     \item Borrowing imperative algorithms via the State monad.
%     \item Data.Graph by King & Launchbury, 1995. \url{https://galois.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pub_JL_StructuringDFSAlgorithms.pdf}.
