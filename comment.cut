  I would like to thank Arseniy Alekseyev and Neil Mitchell
  for numerous discussions on algebraic graphs, their advice,
  criticism and encouragement. Without their help this work would
  have likely remained an unfinished toy project.
  Simon Peyton Jones, Brent Yorgey, and several anonymous reviewers
  provided constructive suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper,
  helping to substantially improve it. Last but not least, I'm very
  grateful to Victor Khomenko for his contribution to the algebra of
  parameterised graphs that forms the mathematical foundation of this work.
