\section{Related work}\label{sec-related}

Historically, first approaches to graph representation in functional programming
used edge lists, adjacency lists, as well as mutually recursive data structures
representing cyclic graphs by the so-called `tying the knot' approach. The former
were generally slower
than their imperative counterparts, while the latter were very difficult to
work with. An asymptotically optimal implementation of the depth-first search
algorithm developed by~\citet{1995_king_graphs} used arrays to represent graphs
and \emph{state-transformer monads}~\cite{1994_launchbury_st} to mimic imperative array
updates in pure functional programming. The developed algorithms are still in
use today and are available from the \textsf{containers} library shipped with the GHC.
As demonstrated in the introduction section~\S\ref{sec-intro}, the API of
the library is difficult to use and contains partial functions.

A fundamentally different approach by~\citet{2001_erwig_inductive} is based
on \emph{inductive graphs}, whereby a graph can be decomposed into a \emph{context}
(a node with its neighbourhood) and the rest of the graph. This inductive
definition makes it possible to share common subgraphs and provides a way to
implement graph algorithms in a more functional style compared to the previous
approaches based on array representations. Inductive graphs are implemented in
the \textsf{fgl} library that contains implementations of many standard graph
algorithms, from depth-first search to maximum flow on weighted graphs. Compared
to algebraic graphs proposed in this paper, the \textsf{fgl} library has a larger
core of graph construction primitives (10 vs 4), some of which are partial, as
has been shown in~\S\ref{sec-intro}.

Several other authors investigated ways to define graphs compositionally,
e.g.~\citet{1995_gibbons_algebra} proposed an algebraic framework for modelling
acyclic graphs comprising 6 core graph construction primitives, but the approach
was not general enough to handle other practically useful classes of graphs.

From a very different angle, simple algebraic structures, such as \emph{semirings},
have been successfully applied to solving various path problems on graphs using
functional programming, e.g. see~\citet{2013_semirings_dolan}. These approaches
typically use matrix-based data structures for manipulating connectivity and distance
information with the goal of solving optimisation problems on graphs, and are not
suitable as an abstract interface for graph representation.

This paper builds on the work by~\citet{2014_algebra_mokhov}, where
the \emph{algebra of parameterised graphs}, a mathematical
structure very similar to a semiring, was proposed as a complete and sound formalism
for graph representation in the context of digital circuit design. The authors did
not investigate applications of the algebra in functional programming but proved
many important results that are essential for this paper.
\citet{2014_alekseyev_phd} derived a formalisation of the algebra of parameterised
graphs in the Agda programming language, using an encoding similar to
the core type class that we define.
