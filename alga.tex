\begin{abstract}
The paper presents a minimalistic, elegant and powerful approach to working
with graphs in a functional programming language. The approach is built on
a rigorous mathematical foundation --- an algebra of graphs --- that allows
to apply equational reasoning for proving the correctness of graph transformation
algorithms. One useful feature of the presented approach compared to the
state-of-the-art graph libraries is that it allows to avoid partial functions on
graphs, which are typically required for handling `malformed graphs' that contain an
edge referring to a non-existent vertex. Algebraic graphs make it impossible to
specify such malformed graphs, thereby solving this issue at the root.

The basic definition of algebraic graphs corresponds to unlabelled directed graphs.
We show that by introducing additional axioms to the algebra, it is possible to also
represent undirected, reflexive, transitively closed, and labelled graphs.
We derive basic graph transformation algorithms that are polymorphic and can
therefore be reused by all graph instances, and demonstrate the flexibility of
algebraic graphs by a few examples.

\section{Introduction}

Text of paper \ldots

Focus not on graph algorithms, but more on convenient graph specification/transformation language.

"Unlike traditional approaches
based on mutable references or node/edge lists, well-formedness of
the graph structure is ensured statically and reasoning can be done
with standard functional programming techniques."
